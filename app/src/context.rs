//! What the app's work shares, whichever front end asks for it: the database, the taxonomy, the
//! local user, where the API keys are kept, Laya, the app's own llama.cpp model, the Jobnet
//! extension's folder, the database file and the job scan's schedule.
//!
//! The web server keeps its own state beside this (server::AppState: the flash message, the
//! port, the Tailscale name, the page reloads), so a desktop window can run the same work
//! (matches::match_service) without a web server's parts.
