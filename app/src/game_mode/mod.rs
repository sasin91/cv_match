//! Whether a game runs, which background work shouldn't slow down: a game, a presentation, or
//! another full-screen app. Each signal the computer gives is asked in turn, and the first that
//! says so is why (Playing):
//!
//! - Windows' own "do not disturb" state (SHQueryUserNotificationState, which Windows also uses
//!   to hold back notifications): exclusive full-screen games and presentations.
//! - The app in front is one the Xbox Game Bar knows as a game (its list in
//!   HKCU\System\GameConfigStore\Children, the one Windows' Game Mode goes by). This catches
//!   the borderless windowed games the first misses.
//! - The app in front is in a folder the Epic Games launcher or Battle.net installed a game in
//!   (launchers): neither says which game runs, as Steam does.
//! - The app in front keeps the graphics card's 3D engine busy, a quarter or more since the
//!   last look (gpu): any game, by what it does rather than its name (Windows only).
//! - Steam runs a game: its RunningAppID (Windows' registry, or ~/.steam/registry.vdf).
//! - Feral's gamemode runs a game (its ClientCount on the session D-Bus), which games started
//!   with `gamemoderun` (Steam's launch option `gamemoderun %command%`) ask for on Linux.
//!
//! Windows' Game Mode itself can't be asked from outside: HasExpandedResources answers for the
//! calling process only.
//!
//! The answer is kept for LOOK_AGAIN_AFTER (GameMode, one per Context), so the many calls of a
//! scan don't each read the registry or D-Bus. While a game runs, work that would run on this
//! computer runs on the user's cloud key (stand_in); without one the job scan waits until the
//! game ends (wait_until_over). The models let go of the graphics card as soon as no call needs
//! them (idle).
