//! The still-open check: whether a saved match's job still takes applications.
//!
//! A job is closed when the deadline its post gives has passed (read with joblog::deadline, as
//! the Jobnet joblog panel reads it), when its post was taken down (the page answers 404 or 410,
//! or Jobnet no longer has the ad), when its page says it is closed, or when its link now lands
//! on the site's front page or search page. A page that can't be read says nothing: the job
//! stays as it was, and is read again next time. No language model is asked.
//!
//! The check runs after every scan (scan_service) and from the "Check now" button of Saved
//! matches. Each post is read at most once in READ_EVERY_SECONDS; the deadline is looked at
//! every time, since that costs no fetch.
