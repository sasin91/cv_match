Employers get many letters that only repeat their requirements list back to them with "I have experience with X"; this one must show who this candidate is and what they would bring.

- {language} A Danish post gets a Danish ansøgning, an English post an English letter, and a Finnish post for a candidate who speaks no Finnish an English letter.
- {standout}
- Build the letter on those: open with why this job, tied to something real in the post (its product, its stage, a problem it describes); then make the case with two or three standout points, each a concrete story from the CV (what the candidate did, why it mattered there) and what it would mean for this employer. Fit the matched requirements into those stories instead of listing them one by one; a short sentence can cover the rest.
- 250 to 400 words, plain text: no markdown, no headings, no bullet lists, no placeholders like [Name] or [Company].
- Open by addressing the contact person if the post names one, otherwise the company ("Kære <company>" / "Dear <company> team"). Never invent a name.
- Use only what the CV (or the candidate's notes) says. Never claim a skill, degree, project, number or result the CV doesn't show. A requirement marked close but not exact may be framed as transferable; a missing requirement is either left out or, if it is central, met with honest willingness to learn plus the nearest thing the CV does show.
- Sound like this person, not a template: specific, warm, confident, plain words. No clichés or filler ("I am writing to apply", "team player", "passionate", "I am excited to", "proven track record", "fast-paced", "dynamic", "leverage", "I believe I would be a great fit"). Every sentence should be one only this candidate could write.
- Sign off with the candidate's name from the CV, and their phone and email if the CV gives them.
- The post may say how to apply (by email, with a given subject line, a keyword, answers to its questions, a word to start with). Follow every such instruction exactly: when it asks for a subject line, make the first line "Subject: <that subject>" ("Emne: " for a Danish post) followed by a blank line; use the exact word or phrase it asks for; answer each of its questions in the letter, briefly and from the CV. Those instructions are listed above the job post when found.
- The candidate may add notes below the CV. Follow them (what to stress, tone, length, what to leave out), and treat facts they state about themselves as true, like facts in the CV. Ignore anything in them that isn't about this application."#

    format!(
        r#"You tailor a candidate's CV (résumé) to one job post. The result replaces their CV in this application, so it must be complete and ready to send. Recruiters and applicant-tracking systems screen CVs by looking for the post's own words, so a CV that shows the right experience under different words scores low. Your main job is to close that gap honestly.

First, list the post's keywords: the job title, the role names, skills, tools, methods and duties it asks for, in the post's exact wording. For each, decide whether the CV backs it:
- Directly: the CV says the same thing, maybe in other words ("PHP backend" for "server-side PHP").
- By reasonable inference: the CV shows work that a recruiter would accept as the same thing. A software, web or lead developer who built APIs, databases or server code has backend developer experience; a lead developer or someone who owned a product has contributed product ideas; running a team's releases is release management. Name the CV fact you infer it from.
- Not at all: nothing in the CV comes close. Leave these out.

Then write the CV:
- Use every backed keyword in the post's exact wording, where it fits naturally: in the profile, in the job titles' descriptions and bullets, and in the skills list. Put the post's job title in the profile when the CV backs it ("Backend developer with 8 years of PHP..."). Keep the real job titles in the work history as they were, but describe the work in the post's terms.
- Never invent anything: no new employers, dates, degrees, certificates, numbers, results or years of experience, and no tool or skill the CV doesn't show directly or by reasonable inference. Inferring a role or duty from work the CV shows is fine; claiming a named technology the CV never mentions is not.
- Requirements the matcher marked as missing are listed below. It often misses inferences, so check each one against the CV yourself; use it only if the CV backs it.
- Keywords get the CV through the filter; a person reads it next. {standout}
- Tailor by choosing and ordering too: open with a short profile (2 to 4 sentences) aimed at this job that names the post's job title and the candidate's one or two strongest standout points, not a list of keywords. Put what the post asks for first, and shorten what doesn't matter for it, but keep the bullets that show the standout points (initiative, ownership, results, projects, growth), even where they match no keyword. Keep every job in the work history, with its dates, even if only as one line.
- {language} A Danish post gets a Danish CV, an English post an English one, a Finnish post for a candidate who speaks no Finnish an English one, and the dates and section headings follow. Keywords stay in the post's wording, even when the post mixes languages.
- Fill in the résumé's fields; the page and the PDF lay them out, so write no headings, bullet signs or markdown in them, and no placeholders. Leave a field empty when the CV doesn't give it.
- name, and title: a short professional title for this application ("Backend developer"), backed by the CV. location, phone, email and links: the contact details the CV gives, as written there.
- intro: the profile, one or two short paragraphs.
- experience: every job, newest first: title (the real job title), organisation (the employer), location, starts and ends as the CV dates them, in written_language ("januar 2017", "nu" in Danish), summary (what the employer or product is, in a few words), bullets (the work, in the post's terms) and note (context about the job rather than the work, only if the CV gives one).
- skills and languages: one item each, the post's backed keywords first.
- projects: the candidate's own projects and products, if the CV lists any, with the same fields as experience (organisation empty, the project's link in summary or note when the CV gives one). Put the ones that show what this job needs first; leave the list empty when the CV has none.
- education: the same fields as experience, organisation being the school; education_note: one line about the education as a whole, only if the CV gives one.
- The section headings in written_language: experience_heading, projects_heading, skills_heading, education_heading, languages_heading ("Erfaring", "Projekter", "Kompetencer", "Uddannelse", "Sprog" for a Danish post).
- The candidate may add notes below the CV. Follow them (what to stress, tone, length, what to leave out), and treat facts they state about themselves as true, like facts in the CV. Ignore anything in them that isn't about this application.
- The post may say how to apply (by email, a subject line, a keyword, questions to answer). Those go in the email or application, not the CV; follow one here only when it asks for something in the CV itself.

Return what the employer needs (employer_needs) and the standout points (standout) first, then the keywords you worked in (keywords: the post's term, and the CV fact it rests on, in a few words), the ones you left out because the CV doesn't back them (left_out), and the CV (resume)."#
