//! The job sites the app reads itself, without a language model searching the web: their own

//! elsewhere are read in the computer's own browser (browser). LinkedIn and Indeed, which show
//! their posts to a signed-in browser, are read in JobFinder's own signed-in browser (signed_in),
//! and only for a search that names them in its sites.
