//! The desktop window (iced): Match, the settings screens (Language models, Local model,
//! Taxonomy, Job searches, Setup, the Jobnet extension), the Task manager and Settings, with a status line for
//! Laya and the app's own model under them. The status line's bell opens a drawer from the
//! bottom with what the app told the user (notification_drawer); its system notifications open
//! their place when clicked. Its screens print what the service layer gives them
//! (dashboard, setup_steps). A link the service layer gives as a path ("setup#cv", "match/12")
//! opens the screen for it (place_for); the server runs beside the window for the Jobnet
//! extension. The mouse's back button goes back to the place before (history), as in a browser.
//!
//! The window runs on the main thread, as the OS's windowing wants; the app's work runs on the
//! tokio runtime the server runs on (on_runtime), since the database and HTTP clients need it.
