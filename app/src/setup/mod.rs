//! setup: the first-run wizard, which the window opens (desktop::setup_screen) on a database
//! that hasn't been set up (setup_steps::is_first_run). Its steps, in order:
//!
//! 1. The database: made at start-up; the wizard says where it is.
//! 2. The AI model: this app's own llama.cpp model when the computer has room for a good one,
//!    else an OpenAI or Claude key (model_advice). The steps themselves are the Local model and
//!    Language models screens, which come back here while the setup isn't finished.
//! 3. The CV, read into the profile (profile_fill), which needs the model.
//! 4. How often the job scan runs by itself: a Task Scheduler task (scan_schedule).
//! 5. The dashboard: the Match screen.
//!
//! The steps' state and their work are in setup_steps.
