# JobFinder: Jobnet joblog

A browser extension that fills in Jobnet's "Opret joblog" form from a saved
match in JobFinder's CV checker: the same values the match's "Jobnet joblog"
panel shows (`match/joblog/{id}`, app/src/matches/joblog.rs), and the
application, CV and job post as PDFs in Jobnet's upload fields. It never
presses Gem: check the form and save it yourself.

One folder for Chrome, Edge and Firefox (Manifest V3). No build step.

## Install

It talks to the JobFinder desktop app (`app/` in this repo) on this computer,
http://127.0.0.1:8765/, which ships this folder: the app's "Jobnet extension"
screen (under Settings) says where it wrote it and how to load it in Edge or Chrome ("Load
unpacked"). The `key` in manifest.json fixes the extension's ID
(jijhihfppobcoconjjllmffbohpffbll), which is how the app knows the changes it
sends come from this extension. Firefox gives each install its own ID, so it
works with the website only.

For the website instead, set `base` in the extension's storage to
`https://recruiter.trongate.dev/` and sign in to Recruiter in the same browser:
the extension uses that sign-in.

From the browser stores: the links are on https://recruiter.trongate.dev/joblog_extension,
and the candidate's pages show a banner with the one for your browser until the extension is installed.

From this folder (development, or before a store has it):

- **Edge**: `edge://extensions`, turn on Developer mode, "Load unpacked", pick
  this folder.
- **Chrome**: `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer mode, "Load unpacked",
  pick this folder.
- **Firefox** (140 or later): `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, "Load
  Temporary Add-on…", pick `manifest.json` (it stays until Firefox restarts).

## Use

Open Jobnet, Joblog, "Opret joblog". A "Fill from JobFinder" box shows in the
bottom right corner: pick the saved match and press "Fill in the form". The box
lists what it filled and what it couldn't.

The matches you have applied for but not entered on Jobnet yet (status Søgt or
Samtale in the match's joblog panel, "entered on Jobnet" not ticked: the list
"Applied, not on Jobnet yet" on JobFinder) come first in the box, with how many
there are. When you press Gem on a form the box filled in and Jobnet saves it
(the form closes), the box ticks "entered on Jobnet" for that match in
JobFinder, with the status the form had, so it leaves that list. Closing the
form with Luk or Fortryd marks nothing.

The job title is the match's own, typed in as it is. Jobnet only keeps a
company or postcode picked from its own suggestions (the CVR register,
postcodes) and clears typed text. So for those the extension searches with the
value, then with parts of it, and picks the suggestion sharing the most words
with it: "Nordisk Fragt A/S" becomes "Nordisk Fragt ApS". The box says when it
picked something other than the value itself. When nothing fits, the company
keeps its name as typed and the postcode is left empty.

"Hvilken dato har du søgt jobbet?" (only asked at Søgt or Samtale) gets the day
you set that status in JobFinder.

### Send a job post to JobFinder

On any job post's page (LinkedIn and Indeed too, signed in), press the
extension's toolbar button: the popup names the page, lets you pick the job
search to add it to (the last one picked comes first; with one search there is
nothing to pick) and Send adds it, from the page's HTML as your browser shows it
(`job_scan/submit_page`). JobFinder matches it like a post its scan found, and
it shows under that search on the Job searches screen. The extension reads the page only when you
press the button (activeTab), and puts nothing into the sites' pages.

## How it works

- `content.js` runs on jobnet.dk. Jobnet's form is React, which ignores values
  set from outside, so each value is set through the element's own prototype
  setter and announced with an input event, as typing would; radio buttons and
  the checkbox are clicked; PDFs are attached to the upload fields with a
  DataTransfer.
- `recruiter.js` runs on Recruiter's own pages and only sets
  `data-jobnet-joblog="<version>"` on the page, so its "add the extension"
  banner stays hidden.
- `background.js` fetches from JobFinder (a content script can't fetch from
  another site): the saved matches (`match/history`), the joblog entry and
  the PDFs (`match/pdf`), with your cookie (on the website), and marks a match as
  entered on Jobnet (`match/joblog_status`).

To point it at another copy of JobFinder (a dev machine), set `base` in the
extension's storage, e.g. from its service worker console:
`chrome.storage.local.set({ base: "http://recruiter.test/" })`, and add that
address to `host_permissions`.

## Publishing

`make extension` (in the repository root) builds `build/jobnet-joblog-<version>.zip`,
the file each store takes: the manifest, the scripts and `icons/`. Bump
`version` in manifest.json for every upload. `store/` holds what the stores
ask for besides the zip: the 440x280 promo tile (Chrome), the 300x300 logo
(Edge) and `listing.md`, the texts for the store forms. The privacy policy is
the "Privacy policy" part of the web app's /joblog_extension page; change it
with the manifest.

## Fill in an application form

On an employer's own application form (Recruitee, Teamtailor, Greenhouse,
Workday and the like), press the extension's toolbar button. Under "Fill in
this application form", pick the saved match it is for (the one whose post the
page comes from is picked already: its address, or the company in the address
or the tab's title) and press "Fill in". A box in the page's corner says what
went in each field and what was left for you; filled fields get a green
outline, the ones left a yellow one. Click a line to scroll to its field.

It asks JobFinder what goes in each empty field (`match/application_form`,
app/src/matches/application_form.rs):

- name, email, phone, city and the LinkedIn, GitHub and website links come
  from your profile;
- a cover letter upload gets the written application as a PDF, a CV or résumé
  upload the tailored résumé (the CV the match was made with when there is
  none); a cover letter text box gets the application's text;
- the questions ("What made you interested in us?", a team to pick) are
  answered by the model that writes your applications, from the CV, the post
  and the application. It leaves empty what they don't say (salary, notice
  period, start date), and a choice is always one of the form's own options.

Once you have sent the form, press "I sent it: mark as applied" in the box:
the match is marked as applied for in JobFinder (Søgt, today, unless it is at
Samtale already), so it shows under "Applied, not on Jobnet yet" and the
Jobnet joblog panel offers it first. "Mark as applied" in the popup does the
same for the picked match, for an application you sent some other way.

Fields that already have something in them are kept as they are. A consent or
privacy box is never ticked, and nothing is sent: read every answer, then send
the form yourself.

It works on the page's own form, not one inside a frame or a pop-up from
another site (open that on its own page first), and on plain fields: a
drop-down the site draws itself instead of a `<select>` is left for you.
